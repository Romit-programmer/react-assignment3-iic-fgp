Here's a brief overview of what I have learned about React:

JSX - A syntax that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript files

Virtual DOM is React's way of efficiently updating the actual webpage
Fibre is the internal engine that manages these updates


Components and Props

Props are how we pass data between components
They enable reusable UI components


Important Hooks

useState: For managing component state
useEffect: For handling side effects
useRef: For persisting values between renders
useCallback: For optimizing performance with callbacks
Custom hooks: For reusing logic across components
